# University Management System üéì

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-17-orange) ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-8.0-blue) ![UI](https://img.shields.io/badge/UI-Java%20Swing-red)

A comprehensive, desktop-based University Management System built with **Java Swing** and **MySQL**. This application provides a modern, secure, and user-friendly interface for managing student and faculty data, academic records, and administrative tasks.

This project was initially inspired by the "TechCoder A.V." YouTube playlist and was then completely refactored and enhanced with modern UI/UX, robust security features, and improved code architecture.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To get this project running locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites
* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17** or later.
* **MySQL Server 8.0** or later.
* An IDE like **IntelliJ IDEA** or Eclipse.

### 2. Database Setup
The complete SQL script to set up your database is included in this repository.
1.  Open your MySQL client (like MySQL Workbench).
2.  Run the entire script provided in the **`Query.sql`** file. This will:
    * Create the `university_management_DB` database.
    * Create all the required tables (`student`, `teacher`, `login`, `fee`, etc.).
    * Insert initial sample data to get you started.

### 3. Project Configuration
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR-REPOSITORY-LINK]
    ```
2.  **Open the project** in your IDE.
3.  **Configure Libraries:** Make sure all the necessary `.jar` files are included in your project's classpath. In IntelliJ, you can do this by right-clicking the `jar` files in the `jar_con` folder and selecting "Add as Library...". The required libraries are:
    * `flatlaf-3.6.jar` (or newer)
    * `flatlaf-extras-....jar`
    * `jcalendar-tz-....jar`
    * `mysql-connector-java-....jar`
    * `ResultSet2xml.jar`
4.  **Database Connection:** Open the `ConnectionForSystem.java` file and update the database credentials if they are different from the default:
    ```java
    connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql:///university_management_DB", "YOUR-USERNAME", "YOUR-PASSWORD");
    ```

### 4. Running the Application
The main entry point for the application is the **`Splash.java`** file. Run this file to start the application.
